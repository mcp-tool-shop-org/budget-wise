# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in BudgetWise, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately:

- Email: security@localhost (replace with a real address before public release)
- Or use GitHub Security Advisories if enabled for the repository

Include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)
- Any proof-of-concept code (if safe)

## Supported Versions

During early development, only the latest `main` branch and the latest RC tag (if any) are considered supported.
